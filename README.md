# Emotion-Detector-With-Opencv
Created a Software which will detect the emotions of the face whether the person is angry or happy or sad.We will did this with the help of opencv and keras model as we have a dataset of images and trained them.
The dataset is available at  https://www.kaggle.com/msambare/fer2013?
The model that i created here is also available but that was not that much accurate but giving the result just your camera position should be good.
